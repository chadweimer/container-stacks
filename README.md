# container-stacks

My personal container stacks

## Usage

These stacks are designed to be used with [Portainer](https://portainer.io) with suppliedcd environment variables, or `.env` files when used with docker compose directly.
Refer to the `stack.env.example` file in each directory for the list of environment variables that are expected.
